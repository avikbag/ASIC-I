                               set_timing_derate

NAME
       set_timing_derate
              Sets  a  derating  factor  on  the  current  design or specified
              objects.  Derating  factors  adjust  the  worst-case  calculated
              delays for a particular operating condition.

   Data Types
       value           float
       object_list     list

ARGUMENTS
       -rise  Applies the derating value only to the delays of paths that have
              a rising transition at the specified objects.

       -fall  Applies the derating value only to the delays of paths that have
              a falling transition at the specified objects.

              If  neither  the  -rise nor -fall option is used in the command,
              the derating value applies to both rise and fall.

       -min   Applies the derating value only to the minimum operating  condi-
              tion.

       -max   Applies  the derating value only to the maximum operating condi-
              tion.

              If neither the -min nor -max option is used in the command,  the
              derating value applies to both operating conditions.

       -early Applies  the  derating  factor  only  to  minimum  delays, which
              defines how early a signal can arrive.  The  factor  applies  to
              clock path delays in a setup check, and to data path delays in a
              hold check.

       -late  Applies the  derating  factor  only  to  maximum  delays,  which
              defines how late a signal can arrive. The factor applies to data
              path delays in a setup check, and to clock path delays in a hold
              check.

              If  neither  the -early nor -late option is used in the command,
              the derating value applies to early and late delays.

       -clock Applies the derating value only to elements in  the  clock  net-
              work.

       -data  Applies the derating value only to elements in the data network.

              If neither the -clock nor -data option is used in  the  command,
              the derating value applies to both clock paths and data paths.

       -net_delay
              Applies the derating value only to net delay, which is the delay
              from the driver to the receiver of each net.  This option cannot
              be  used with an object list.  There is only one set of derating
              values for net delays and they apply to the whole design.

       -cell_delay
              Applies the derating value only to  cell  delay,  which  is  the
              delay from the input to the output of a cell.

       -cell_check
              Applies  the  derating value to the setup and hold time require-
              ments of cells: cell setup and cell recovery times for late der-
              ating  or  cell  hold and cell removal times for early derating.
              This option cannot be used together  with  the  -aocvm_guardband
              option.

       value  Specifies  the derating value, which must be in the range of 0.1
              to 2.0.

       object_list
              Specifies the leaf cells, instances, or library cells  on  which
              to  set  the  derating  factor. To ensure that the setting on an
              instance is preserved during optimization,  the  tool  sets  the
              size_only attribute of the instance to true.

DESCRIPTION
       The  set_timing_derate  command  sets  derating factors for the current
       design or specified objects.  If a timing derating factor is specified,
       some or all path delays are multiplied by the derating factor.

       Derating factors define the lower and upper ranges of timing delays for
       a certain operating condition.  The derating factor specified with  the
       -late  option  is  multiplied by the data path delays for maximum delay
       (setup) checking and clock path delays for minimum delay (hold)  check-
       ing.   Conversely, the derating factor specified with the -early option
       is multiplied by the data path delays for hold checking and clock  path
       delays for setup checking.

       The  -net_delay,  -cell_delay, and -cell_check options apply the speci-
       fied derating value to net delays, cell delays, or cell setup and  hold
       time requirements, respectively. The -net_delay option can apply to the
       whole design only, so it cannot be used with an object list.

       If none of these three options is used and an object list is  provided,
       the  derating  value  applies  to cell delay only; if no object list is
       provided, the value applies to both cell delay and net delay.

       The setup timing check is calculated using the maximum operating condi-
       tion.   The hold timing check is calculated using the minimum operating
       condition.

       Input delay and ideal clock network latency are not derated.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command applies to the current scenario only.   By  default,  when
       you  set  timing  derating  factors  on  a library cell, the setting is
       applied to all scenarios. You can control whether timing derating  fac-
       tors   on   library   cells   are   scenario-specific  with  the   tim-
       ing_library_derate_is_scenario_specific variable. If this  variable  is
       true  when  you  set  the timing derating factor on a library cell, the
       timing derating factors apply to the current scenario  only.  For  more
       information,  see  the  man  page for the timing_library_derate_is_sce-
       nario_specific variable.

EXAMPLES
       The following example specifies an early derating value of  0.9  and  a
       late  derating  value  of 1.1 for all clock network nets at the maximum
       operating condition.

         prompt> set_timing_derate -max -early -net_delay 0.9
         prompt> set_timing_derate -max -late -net_delay 1.1

       The following example specifies an early derating value of  0.8  and  a
       late  derating  value  of 1.2 for leaf cell U1 at the maximum operating
       condition.

         prompt> set_timing_derate -max -early 0.8 U1
         prompt> set_timing_derate -max -late 1.2 U1
