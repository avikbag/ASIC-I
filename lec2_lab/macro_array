               [-reset]

ARGUMENTS
       -name string
              Specifies name for the macro array.

       -elements collection_of_macro_cell_objects
              Specifies  a  collection  or  list-of_collection  of macro cells
              which will compose the macro array.  Each sublist  represents  a
              row  in  the  array.  An  array starts from top most row.  A row
              starts from left. For example, to describe the following array,

              A11 A12 A13
              A21 A22 A23
              A31 A32 A33
              specify this argument as shown below.
              -elements [list [get_cells "A11 A12 A13"] \
                              [get_cells "A21 A22 A23"] \
                              [get_cells "A31 A32 A33"]]
              This is a required argument when creating a macro array.  It  is
              not  required  when  the -reset option is used to remove a macro
              array.

       -align_edge t | b | l | r | c | top | bottom | left | right | center
              Specifies an edge for the macro cells in one row to align  with.
              Default is to align to the centers.

       -align_pins {list of two pin objects}
              Specifies  list  of  pins to align two macro cells with pins. In
              the list, the first pin is a pin on reference cell  (first  cell
              in the array) and the second pin is a pin from second cell. This
              option takes effect only if specified array has two macro cells.

       -x_offset float
              Specifies the distance between two adjacent edges of macro cells
              on one row.  Unit is micron. The default value is 0, which means
              the cells abut to each other.

       -y_offset float
              Specifies the distance between two adjacent edges of macro cells
              on the same column of the next row.  Unit is micron. The default
              value is 0, which means the cells abut to each other.

       -use_keepout_margin
              Instructs  the  tool  to use the keepout margin to determine the
              spacing between two adjacent rows and/or columns of  the  array.
              This option is mutually exclusive with the -x_offset and -y_off-
              set options.

       -vertical
              Instructs the tool to arrange an array vertically. If  specified
              for  an one-dimensional array, the tool arranges one dimensional
              macros in a vertical column.  By default these arrays  are  cre-
              ated  as  horizontal  rows.   If specified for a two-dimensional
              array, the tool arranges the array in  column  based  structure,
              instead  of  row based structure. It is like rotate a two dimen-
              sional array 90 degrees counter-clock-wise.

       -rectilinear
              Specifies the overall rectilinear shape  of  a  two  dimensional
              array.  For a rectilinear macro array, you can specify different
              number of cells in different rows.  By default, in design  plan-
              ning, a two-dimensional macro array is placed as a single object
              that is rectangular in shape, and all the  rows(or  columns)  in
              the array have the same number of cells.

       -align_2d  lb  |  lc | lt | rb | rc | rt | cb | cc | cr | left-bottom |
       left-center | left-top | right-bottom | right-center | right-top | cen-
       ter-bottom | center-center | center-top
              Specifies the edges for the macro cells in a row or column to be
              aligned with, in a heterogeneous  two-dimensional  macro  array.
              This  argument  is  optional.   By  default, the tool aligns the
              cells in the same column by their  left  edge,  and  aligns  the
              cells in the same row by their bottom edge.

       -reset Removes  the  macro  array  constraint.  This option is mutually
              exclusive with all other options except for -name.

DESCRIPTION
       The set_fp_macro_array command defines an array  of  macro  cells.  The
       tool places macro cells in the array according to the parameters speci-
       fied for the array.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command has no dependency on scenario-specific information.

EXAMPLES
       The following example shows how to specify a 2x2 array for cell A11 A12
       A21 A22 with 10 microns space between rows and columns.

         prompt>set_fp_macro_array -name AA \
                       -elements [list [get_cells "A11 A12"] [get_cells "A21 A22"]] \
                       -x_offset 10 -y_offset 10

       The  following  example  shows how to remove a previously defined macro
       array ICRAMARRAY1.
         prompt>set_fp_macro_array -name ICRAMARRAY1 -reset
